Things I learned:

Model-View-Controller Architecture: ASP.NET Core MVC follows the MVC architectural pattern, which separates an application into three main components: the Model, View, and Controller. The Model represents the data and business logic, the View displays the user interface, and the Controller handles user input and orchestrates the flow of data between the Model and the View. Understanding and implementing this architecture helped me to develop maintainable web applications.

Razor Pages: Razor Pages is a feature in ASP.NET Core MVC that allows developers to create web pages using a combination of HTML markup and C# code. It simplifies the development process by reducing the amount of ceremony required compared to traditional MVC. Razor Pages provide a clean separation of concerns, making it easier to manage the codebase and enhance the maintainability of the application.

Entity Framework Core: Entity Framework Core is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework by Microsoft. It enables developers to work with databases using object-oriented techniques, eliminating the need to write raw SQL queries. With Entity Framework Core, I learned how to define data models, create database migrations, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and handle database transactions seamlessly within my ASP.NET Core MVC applications.

Here are three helpful tips and best practices for ASP.NET Core MVC web programming:

Dependency Injection (DI): ASP.NET Core has a built-in DI container that allows for the management and resolution of dependencies in an application. Utilizing DI improves the maintainability, testability, and extensibility of the code. I learned to leverage DI to inject dependencies into controllers, services, and other components and enabling loose coupling and facilitating unit testing.

Middleware Pipeline: ASP.NET Core uses a middleware pipeline to process requests and responses. Each middleware component performs a specific task, such as routing, authentication, logging, or error handling. Understanding the middleware pipeline and how to configure and order the middleware components helped me to customize the request/response flow and implement cross-cutting concerns effectively.

Tag Helpers: Tag Helpers are a powerful feature in ASP.NET Core MVC that allows for server-side code execution within HTML tags. They simplify the creation of dynamic views by providing a more natural and readable syntax compared to traditional HTML helpers. I found that using Tag Helpers enhanced my productivity and improved the maintainability of the views by reducing the amount of embedded server-side code.
